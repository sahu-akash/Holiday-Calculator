# Holiday calculator application
It has 3 parts i.e. BusinessComponents , National holiday and index.js file.

The BusinessComponents holds the functions that are used to calculate holidays and used for validation.

National holiday holds the array of holidays for specific geographic location

index.js is the main function or entry point. Run the function holidayCalc(StartDate, EndDate) with apt parameters to get desired output.

e.g. call holidayCalc("2022-05-02", "2022-05-15"); inside the index.js with correct parameters and then run command <node index.js> 


# Write a short description of how you understood the problem, 

I understood that I have to code a scalable business logic that can be attached to an existing machine or used independently to calculate holidays

# what challenges you had with the implementation and what you could further improve in your implementation.

I could have used an OOPS language for example JAVA if i had more time but due to other commitments i went ahead with JS and used functional programming partially using SOLID principles.

# If you had to make compromises, we would like to hear about them.
Use JS instead of JAVA or any-other OOPS language
